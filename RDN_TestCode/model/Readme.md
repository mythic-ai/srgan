5. Others

    Only RDN_BIX2.t7 was trained using 48x48 input patches. 

    All other models were trained using 32x32 input patches in order to save training time.
    However, smaller input patch size in training would lower the performance to some degree.

    RDN_BDX3.t7 and RDN_DNX3.t7 were fine-tuned based on RDN_BIX3.t7.
